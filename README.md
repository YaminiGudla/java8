--> The lambda exp return type should be an interface with only one unimplemented method.
-->Used Comparator functional interface with lambda exp to compare the length of strings. Same for Runnable Interface.
-->Taken a list of integers converted them into a stream and applied filter n collect methods to achieve the goal.
-->Same for filter,map,reduce.
-->used Function<integer,Integer> functional interface and its apply() to achieve the goal.
-->We have pre defined Functional Interfaces like Predicate,Function,Consumer,Supplier with methods test,apply,accept,get respectively.
